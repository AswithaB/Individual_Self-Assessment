# Individual_Self-Assessment

## Self Assessment
Initially as a team member I contributed to decide the topic for project and the scope of the project.
I took part of the project and worked on collecting real time data and cleaning the data sets for further analysis.
Worked on preparing the data visualizations and also took part in anlysisng the data for representation.

I took part in the team discussions for The tasks that I have not taken part such as preparing Machine Learning models and Data base creations.
Reviewed the models and provided my suggestions to my team members.


## Team Assessment
Each of the team members are strong in respective topics such as Machine Learning, Tableau, Data Base Creation, HTML & CSS, etc.,
Due to this diversity it became easy for collaboration and distribution of tasks over the course of project.
Challenges were taken care through various discussions and advises provided as a team work.
Team members are excellent in terms of communication and work.
Eventhough of some challenges the team was supportive during hard times and made the project successful.
